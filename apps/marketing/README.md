This is a minimal Next.js app used for marketing pages. It includes static
content in `/app` and can be built for deployment via the marketing workflows.

## Scripts

- `pnpm build` – Build the production output.

## TypeScript Configuration

When this project is first built, Next.js may propose updates to
`tsconfig.json`. Those can be committed as needed.
