# Copilot Custom Instructions

Use the canonical playbook in this repo when generating or modifying code/documentation. Key reference:

- [Custom Instructions – Build a Real-Time Local Services Marketplace App](../Custom%20Instructions%20Playbook.md)

Follow the playbook’s stack, milestones, testing, and delivery requirements. Mirror its formatting and terminology when suggesting code or docs. If the playbook and existing code conflict, favor the playbook and note the discrepancy in your suggestions.
